# Conquest Save File Patcher

BSP scrips that work on Pokemon Conquest save data.

It is only known to work on the original US version of Pokemon Conquest. Support for romhacks such as party size expansion is a [planned feature](https://github.com/MathyFurret/conquestsavefiletools/issues/1).

## Download the patch script

See the [releases](https://github.com/MathyFurret/conquestsavefiletools/releases).

## Building the project yourself

On Linux, Mac, or WSL:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MathyFurret/conquestsavefiletools
    cd conquestsavefiletools
    make

This builds conquestsavefiletools.bsp. GCC is used to build the BSP compiler; to use a different C compiler, simply run a command that builds `bsp/bspcomp` yourself.

## Patching your save

Go to https://aaaaaa123456789.github.io/bsp/. Drop the .bsp under "Patch file" and your save file under "Input file", then click "Begin patching" and select the patch you want.
